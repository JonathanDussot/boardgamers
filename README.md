# BoardGamers
BoardGamers is a site that has been created solely with the purpose of sharing the passion of playing boardgames. The site allows users to create posts with some of their favourite games, some of which may be very common around the world, and others which could interest users depending on their specific likes and/or requirements.

## UX

### Site Purpose:
The aim of this site is to bring all *board gamers* together from around the world.  It is still a rather niche market, yet it has been gaining plenty of terrain in recent years with its appealing designs and fun, dynamic experiences capable of uniting an entire family round the table on a friday night in this era of digital dominance.  The *BoardGamers* site alienates no-one as its diverse categories of gaming are endless and bound to attract users regardless of devotion, age or table space.  User can also leave reviews on games others have posted, along with their personal ratings.  They can also like game posts and have instant access to them through the 'Liked' tab.

### Site Goal:
To propagate an extremely healthy and enjoyable hobby with the family as entire communities are now constantly turning to board gaming in order to teach our young generation that there is much more fun to be had in company than in a virtual void, not to mention the many people who have developed a passion throughout their lives and just want to share this with their friends and community. This site will encourage just that.

### Audience:
Naturally it could be assumed that only the 'gaming nerds' may want to reach and enter the gates of our website, but seeing how user-friendly and interactive we have designed our site, it is a warm, welcoming environment for those who wish to take up the hobby or simply indulge themselves with the details.

### Communication:
users are provided with the possibility to view eachother's profiles and, in the future, interact with one another.

### Existing User Goals:
The joy of never feeling old, as we are continuously given new, innovative models of gaming to share and recommend within the community of *BoardGamers*.

### New User Goals:
To feel welcomed by a never-dying culture with a vast variety of gaming genres and complexities to serve as endless means to suit their many needs.

### Future Goals:
- Currently there is a file (CurrentUserContext.js) which will in the future provide a scoreboard of sorts with the top games based on users' average ratings ranked from highest to lowest.
- Users may also benefit from an online forum to discuss trending topics more interactively among the community members.
- An option to inform the community on events held around the world to promote new products and get the *BoardGamers* community more involved in what's to come.

### BUG TESTING:
1. Heroku logs--tail error when deploying to Heroku:
 - Added correctly-written web: gunicorn gems.wsgi to ProcFile to link it correctly.

2. 'unexpected chunk number 1 (expected 0)' error:
 - This was caused be corrupted Data upon using loaddata with json.file according to Tutor Support.
 - Uncommented sqlite database and commented out external database to temporarily work on project before eventually providing a solution (mentioned in bug #3)

3. Opening new external Database:
 - Did pip install and pip freeze with all requirements, created env.py file, added new DB URL and secret key, collectstatic, updated CSRF, did makemigrations and migrate command and yet page would not load correctly.
 - The cloudinary URL was missing within the env.py, this allowed the page to load correctly.

4. CSS styles would not load:
 - Upon using terminal command to copy staticfiles into a template folder, accidently created and nested everything within an additional templates folder so url path did not connect.
 - Moved everything out to the correct template folder and css styles were loading correctly.

5. Admin interface content lacked RichText Editor for content fields in resources app:
 - summernote_fields was not correctly linked to content containers within the admin.py file.

6. Likes generated an error:
 - within the blog's models.py the model's related name for the like button clashed with the comment section, I changed the name so code could correctly distinguish model and this fixed the bug.

7. Validator error message <o:p>:
 - This was due to my population of the content fields having used my microsoft word to draft the tet before adding them to the admin interface, could not be seen in my code.
 - Manually accessed and edited code from Admin interface and deleted the tags.

8. Page would break when screen size was below 768px and only provide images:
 - Deleted 'flex: no-wrap' to fix this issue and correctly display text with the images so users can access post details for each post.

9. Editing a comment while awaiting approval:
 - Page would crash is user were to click on the edit button before comment had been approved.
 - Fixed the issue by removing the edit button for comments awaiting approval.

10. Navbar overflow:
 - Navbar displayed overflow off page between 1150px and 990px on all pages.
 - Reduced the logo size, nav-link size and text-muted size so elements would not cause navbar to overflow before collapsing as media response styles take effect.

11. Like button with a reverse path error:
 - Upon correcting some of the hyphens and underscores, the blog's urls.py path had the correct pattern, but the views.py file still had **'post-detail'** instead of **post_detail** within the reverse function call.

### Unfixed Bugs
1. Sign up form - HTML Validator errors:
- Upon validating, I noticed [4 errors with tags](static/images-readme/signup-html-errors.png) which were nowhere to be found within my code.
- With help from Tutor Support, we determined this was from Django's Allauth's error and that I could do nothing to fix it from my end.
